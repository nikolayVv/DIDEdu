# DIDEdu

DIDEdu is an open code decentralized solution, which is developed to present the advantages of implementing Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) in a system. [Decentralized Identifiers](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) are a new type of identifiers, that enable a verifiable, distributed digital identity. With the help of this technology, DIDEdu offers to its users:
- Issuing of credentials for completed obligations (exams, exercises, lectures, assignments, etc.), subjects, years and programs;
- Authentication/Registration for individual activities (exams, colloquiums, tests, etc.) using credentials or presentations;
- Signing in the website only with a DID;
- Secured data storage;
- Easy to use and user friendly interface;
- Cheaper usage of the Blockchain using Batches;
The main logic is in the DID service, which is developed in Kotlin and is using the Atala PRISM SDK. Atala PRISM SDK is a development kit, which is following the W3C standard and is working on the Cardano Blockchain. It allows developers to use already implemented functionalities, which helps them develop solutions, that are using DIDs and VCs.
